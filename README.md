Introduction

Heart attack is a major cause of death worldwide, and traditional diagnostic methods can be slow and unreliable, which will lead to delays in treatment. This is challenging in areas with limited access to specialized healthcare resources. Through analysis of large datasets, machine learning (ML) could provide a viable approach for early prediction by identifying the key risk factor. This project aims to identify the most significant health indicators of heart attack risk, enhance prediction accuracy to improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare burdens.
